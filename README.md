## How to get started
Clone the PSNIT repository to your machine using PowerShell.
```git
git clone https://github.com/jsalmensuo/PSNIT.git
```
Move into the location.
```git
cd PSNIT
```

### Permission
Confirm the execution policy of your current PowerShell session.
```powershell 
Get-ExecutionPolicy
```

Allow the current session of Powershell to run locally created scripts, this opens a new terminal with temporary privileges.
```powershell 
pwsh.exe -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

If instead you want your execution policy for locally created scripts to be persistent use these.
 ```powershell 
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

#If you want to remove said persistence.
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Undefined
```
### Run the launcher
```powershell
.\PSNIT.ps1
```
